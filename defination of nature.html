        <p><b style="color: blue;"><i>NATURE</i></b>: <b style="color:voilet" >  discovering nature, you discover yourself.” –  Maxime Lagacé, A beautifully penned sentence. Nature is the entire physical world around us in a broad sense.
             It includes atmosphere, weather, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and landscapes. The beautiful environment around us who we call nature is the mother of all humans. It nurtures and nourishes us.
              It provides us with all the necessities to survive. Right from the food we eat, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear, and the houses we live in are the gift of nature. God has only gifted earth with nature, and we should be thankful for that.</p>
              <p>Everything we see around us, right from the moment we step outside our home is part of nature. The trees, animals, landscape, flowers, trees, breeze, sunlight, everything that makes our surroundings so beautiful and mesmerizing are part of nature. Nature does not arise spontaneously but needs years and years to bloom and blossom.

                According to researchers, nature we see today has developed in 4.5 billion years. Initially, the earth was not sustainable for any kind of living thing. The atmosphere had no to very little oxygen, and the same was the case with water. The land made of molten magma and the atmosphere was toxic to survive. Slowly, the earth cooled down, and life started blooming on it. It began to rain, and nature, as we see today, was formed. This nature then gifted the earth with living creatures like animals, birds, and finally, humans.</p>



              <p>it is the Mother Nature who never harms us but always nurtures us. By providing us fruits and vegetables, it nurtures our body. By providing us water hydrates our body, and by providing oxygen, it cleanses our body. It is usually seen that people who live close to nature, especially the villagers live a somewhat happy life as compared to the people living amidst the high hovering skyscrapers. Nature provides our ears sweet sound of birds, rejuvenates us with fresh air, breeze fills our soul with joy, and inspires to flow like the river. Nature provides the raw material for economic development as well.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, humans today are polluting nature in such a way that the healing pace has fallen slowly. The use of plastic, emission of CO2, production of industrial waste, increased use of chemicals, deforestation, poaching, and oil spillage in water bodies are serious concerns today. These are not only polluting nature and are also degrading the quality of the environment needed for the survival of not only animals and birds but also humans</p>
